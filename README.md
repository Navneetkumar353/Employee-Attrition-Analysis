# Employee Attrition Analysis

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at analyzing and predicting employee attrition. The project explores key factors influencing employee turnover through data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights into patterns and trends in the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building and evaluating models to predict employee attrition.
- **Key Insights:** Identifying critical factors that contribute to attrition.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  
   - Applied feature engineering and encoding techniques.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
   - Visualized trends, distributions, and relationships.  
   - Identified key features affecting attrition.  

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Trained multiple machine learning models.  
   - Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy and precision.  

4. **Insights & Recommendations:**  
   - Highlighted factors contributing to attrition.  
   - Provided actionable insights for HR strategy.
